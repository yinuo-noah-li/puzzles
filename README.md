# Puzzles

This repository contains 3 puzzles used for evaluating your general skill level. Each puzzle is in its own folder. The overall instructions are below.

## Initial setup

- All the puzzles require an [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) account. You can use your github account to quickly create an Advent of Code account.
- You will need `git` installed and configured with correct access to github.
- You can use any language, which you will need correctly setup on your system.
- Fork this repository.

## Submitting your work

You should follow the below steps for every puzzle using your own fork. Do not clone down the original repository as you won't have the access to push to it.

1. Create a new branch name appropriately for the puzzle that it will include.
1. Inside the puzzle folder, create a new folder named after your WashU username (the part of your WashU email before the `@`).
1. Place all your code and project files (could include any files for pulling in external dependencies) inside this folder.
1. Include instructions for how to run your code. This should be in the form of a `README.md` file at the root of your solution folder.
1. Do not include your puzzle input. As part of the evaluation, we will run your solution on a different input.
1. Create a pull request to the original repository. Make sure to include your name in the PR description.
